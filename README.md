# NixOS Opt-in State Configs

This repo is my attempt at Opt-in state on NixOS
 These configuration files were created in an attempt at following the article: **[Encypted Btrfs Root with Opt-in State on NixOS](https://mt-caret.github.io/blog/posts/2020-06-29-optin-state.html)**

## Note:
This repo is very much still a work in progress, so please refer to provided link above for a more complete, comprehensive example of opt-in state on NixOS
